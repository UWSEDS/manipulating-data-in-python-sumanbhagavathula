# HW1

This project contains a very high level analysis of the data on the number of bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012. The dataset is available from the [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/) website. The Project is organized into two sub directories: DATA and ANALYSIS. The DATA directory contains the downloaded copy of the Fremont Bridge bicycles dataset and the ANALYSIS directory contains an iPython notebook file that has a very few basic analysis operations on this dataset.

The Dataset contains the following fields: 

1. Date, in the format mm/dd/yyyy HH:00:00 AM/PM, for example: 03/31/2019 11:00:00 PM 
   Note: The dates are rounded to the nearest hour
2. Fremont Bridge East Sidewalk: count of bicycles on the East sidewalk in that hour
3. Fremont Bridge West Sidewalk: count of bicycles on the West sidewalk in that hour
